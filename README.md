# React Multishare Command Extension with PNP-js

## Summary
The sample is an custom action only active on multiple selected items.
This is just a proof of concept, I don't think multishare is viable necessarally.
It uses multiple Office UI Fabric React components:
- Dialog
- Peoplepicker
- Checkbox
- Messagebar
- etc...
The action opens a dialog where the user can choose people from SharePoint in a peoplepicker, to share the selected items with.
It utilizes pnp-js to get suggestions for the peoplepicker, and for the sharing of the listitems.
